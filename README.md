# Brick-Sorting-

# Introduction 
Leveraging the power of machine learning, we have successfully constructed an instrument that brings order to the classification of bricks. By utilizing a controlled environment we created a detailed dataset, coupled with sophisticated sound and image analysis techniques, we can now differentiate bricks into their respective classes: A, B, or C in a non-destructive fashion. This venture represents a milestone in automation for the Construction and Brick industry.
